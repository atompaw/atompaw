ATOMPAW - README
================

## WHAT IS ATOMPAW

The software ATOMPAW generates projector and basis functions which are needed for
performing electronic structure calculations (Density-Functional Theory)
based on the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method.

The program is applicable to materials throughout the periodic table.
For each element, the user inputs the atomic number, the electronic configuration,
a choice of basis functions, and an augmentation radius.
The program produces output files containing the projector and basis functions
and the corresponding matrix elements in a format which can be read by several
DFT codes ([abinit](https://www.abinit.org),
[quantum expresso](https://www.quantum-espresso.org),
[gpaw](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw),
[pwpaw](http://users.wfu.edu/natalie/papers/pwpaw),
[onetep](http://www.onetep.org),
and all codes that can read atomic PAW setups in the
[PAW-XML](https://esl.cecam.org/Paw-xml) format).


Most of the relevant information can be found on the
ATOMPAW [official website](http://users.wfu.edu/natalie/papers/pwpaw).

Many documentation files can be found in the doc directory.
See especially the ~/doc/atompaw-usersguide.pdf file.
