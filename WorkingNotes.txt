In order to make programming/testing easy, Natalie made the following 
changes:    (internal reference try30)
1. kept pkginfo.f90 static
2. Makefile does not link libxc_mod.F90 and commented all references to it
    in abinitinterface.f90 for testing purposes
3. Made changes to abinitinterface.f90 to reflect slightly changed 
   datastructures in atomdata.f90 -- does not yet work for hf
4. Tried to  impliment clean up routines such as DestroyPAW; but these
   may not be complete
5. Load and save functions  need to be updated.   They are useful if the
   atomic calculations take a long time to converge.   As written they take
   a command line argument.  Perhaps not needed??
6. No testing of the scalar relativistic case has been done, and no provisions
   for scalar relativistic with Hartree-Fock are implemented.
7. README file is not up to date
8. Changed options for output with keywords or index numbers (for backward
      compatibility)   No dataset output is generated by default.   The 
      WRITE_XML subroutine skeleton is currently in atompaw_report.f90 module.
9. Tried to remove excess output so that in "EXPLORE" mode the output file
      is not overwhelming -- but more should be removed.
10. Many functions checked for consistency with 3.0.1.9 -- but details
      need further attention...
