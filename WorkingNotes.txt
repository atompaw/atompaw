In order to make programming/testing easy, Natalie made the following 
changes:
1. kept pkginfo.f90 static
2. Did not keep libxc_mod.F90 and commented all references to it
    in abinitinterface.f90 for testing purposes
3. Made changes to abinitinterface.f90 to reflect slightly changed 
   datastructures in atomdata.f90 -- does not work for hf
4. Tried to  impliment clean up routines such as DestroyPAW; but these
   may not be complete
5. Load and save functions  need to be updated.   They are useful if the
   atomic calculations take a long time to converge.   As written they take
   a command line argument.
6. No testing of the scalar relativistic case has been done, and no provisions
   for scalar relativistic and Hartree are implemented.
7. README file is not uptodate
