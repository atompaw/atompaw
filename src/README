03-30-08 -- tested removal of CoreShift from gradient residue
03-31-08 -- removed CoreShift from data structures
04-14-08 -- Try adding shift correction term and restructuring the
               iteration loops
04-23-08 -- Removed zero constrant from optimization and reinstated
               AdjustV
04-24-08 -- Play with function for AdjustV, add iteration loop to find
               Vxcore in Frozencore case, removing CoreShift
04-28-08 -- Fix Vxvale & Vxcore according to notes.  For frozencore
                case FCPot%rvx holds r*Vxvale and HSZ%rVxcore must be added
                to form correct Hamiltonian potential
06-09-08 -- Attempt to adjust match point to stablize solutions for Row 3
                elements
11-26-08 -- From version with Xiao's Colle Salvetti code which is not
                yet quite working; fixing some compatibility with old LDA
12-24-08 -- Start to add atompaw functions back in
01-02-09 -- atompaw functions up to unscreening are back in code.  Attempted
                an alternative method of partitioning Vx into core and valence
                contributions which unfortunately lead to a dead end.  Added
                capability of dumping/loading all-electron results to speed
                up PAW part, controlled with argument.  Also added possibility
                of adjusting lineargrid mesh.
03-28-09 -- Attempt to impose projector orthogonality constraints for multiple
                projector per channel  case
04-09-09 -- Revert to simple iteration procedure
05-14-09 -- Start to program SVD grid method
05-21-09 -- Modify inhomogeneous equation solvers; assume non-singular
                behavior at origin for all l.
06-29-09 -- Modify setcore to first find Vxcore and then iterate a few times
                with Vxvale
07-06-09 -- Modified frozencore energy so the core-valence contribution
                of exchange energy is given by 
                \int d^3r Vx^{core}(v)*\rho_{vale}(r)
08-26-09 -- Version of code without inter-state orthogonalization (again).
09-24-09 -- Copied code from directory
          /home/natalie/EL4/developcode/EXXatompaw/OEP+HF_PAW/NoOrthog_PAW
          in order to start programming Hartree Fock part
12-28-09 -- HF portion including unbound states (not orthogonalized) working
          plausibly
05-21-10 -- Fixed loggrid grid so that n=2001 is fairly close to CFF results
            in Hartree Fock.   Introduce new update scheme for EXX
07-08-10 -- KLI scheme sort of demonstrated for all-electron case;   Restart
            programming for PAW version.
10-06-10 -- Modified HF code to include node counting in order to stabilize
             solutions.
01-22-11 -- Added new keywords and data for Core-electron output in HF/KLI 
             calculations.
07-04-11 -- Add keyword 'LOCALIZEDCOREEXCHANGE" to indicate that
             \tilde{psi}_c == 0.
